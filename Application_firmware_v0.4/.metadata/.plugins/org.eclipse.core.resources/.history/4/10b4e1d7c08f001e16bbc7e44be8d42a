/**@file
 * @brief	ETX OTA Protocol personalized configuration file for Application Firmwares (edit ETX OTA Configurations here).
 *
 * @defgroup app_etx_ota_config Application ETX OTA Protocol Configuration File
 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This file should contain all the Application ETX OTA Protocol Configurations made by the user/implementor.
 *
 * @note    It is highly suggested not to directly edit the Configurations Settings defined in this @ref etx_ota_config
 *          . Instead of doing that whenever requiring different Configuration Settings, it is suggested to do that
 *          instead in this additional header file named as "app_etx_ota_config.h" whose File Path should be located as
 *          a sibling of the @ref etx_ota_config . However, to enable the use of this @ref app_etx_ota_config , you will
 *          also need to change the @ref ENABLE_APP_ETX_OTA_CONFIG define that is located at @ref etx_ota_config , to a
 *          value of 1.
