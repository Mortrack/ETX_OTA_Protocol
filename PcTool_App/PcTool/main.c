/**@brief   Main function of the main application program whose purpose is to receive some ETX OTA Payload Data from the
 *          user via Command Line Arguments to then send it to a user specified device by using the ETX OTA Protocol.
 *
 * @param argc      Contains the total number of Command Line Arguments that are given whenever executing the program
 *                  contained in this file. The total number of arguments consider here will also include the command
 *                  executed on the terminal window to run the program contained in this file. For example, if the
 *                  Terminal Window Command used on the terminal window was
 *                  \code $./a.out 0 1 2 \endcode
 *                  then
 *                  \code argc = 4 \endcode
 * @param[in] argv  Holds the actual Command Line Arguments that are given whenever executing the program contained in
 *                  this file. Each argument will be allocated in a different index within the \p argv param, but were
 *                  the first index will contain the command executed on the terminal window to run the program
 *                  contained in this file and then the actual Command Line Arguments will be placed subsequently. For
 *                  example, if the Terminal Window Command used on the terminal window was
 *                  \code $./a.out 0 1 2 \endcode
 *                  then
 *                  \code argv[4] = {"./a.out", "0", "1", "2"} \endcode
 *
 * @note    This @ref main function expects to be given the following Command Line Arguments via the \p argv param:<br>
 *          <ul>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 0 = @ref TERMINAL_WINDOW_EXECUTION_COMMAND </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 1 = @ref COMPORT_NUMBER </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 2 = @ref PAYLOAD_PATH </li>
 *              <li>Command Line Argument index 3 = @ref ETX_OTA_Payload_t </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @note    Although this @ref main function requires the user to always populate a value for the Command Line Argument
 *          2, its value will only be used by this program whenever the value of the Command Line Argument index 3 is
 *          that of either a @ref ETX_OTA_Payload_t::ETX_OTA_Application_Firmware_Image or a @ref
 *          ETX_OTA_Payload_t::ETX_OTA_Bootloader_Firmware_Image . In addition, whenever the @ref
 *          ETX_OTA_Payload_t::ETX_OTA_Custom_Data type is given instead, then this program will send a fixed custom
 *          generated data that is formualted in the @ref start_etx_ota_process function.
 *
 * @retval  ETX_OTA_EC_OK
 * @retval  ETX_OTA_EC_ERR
